## Elixir Language

Elixir is a functional language with immutable state

### Difference with OOP and FP

In OOP , we hide data in Classes , objects and we worry about not changing state , In Elixir , We want to transform data from one form to another , we don't care about state , we care about data transformation .

### Functional Programming

In Elixir , everything is broken down into functions , the smaller , the better they are to reuse and they can all run in parallel .

### Installing Elixir

[`Installing Elixir Documentation`](http://elixir-lang.org/install.html)

### IEX - Interactive Elixir

Go to your Shell terminal and run

```sh
iex
```

#### IEX Helpers

To get all of them inside iex run

```sh
h
```

The most popular ones are

```sh
i - information about data types
h - help
v - history
c - compile
r - reload
```

We use h to get help on elixir functions , eg `IO.puts`
If you run `h IO.puts` , you will get

````sh

Writes item to the given device, similar to write/2, but adds a newline at the
end.


    IO.puts("Hello World!")
    #=> Hello World!

    IO.puts(:stderr, "error")
    #=> error


    ```
````

### Compiling And Running Elixir

We can have elixir code in source files , here, you will note they either end with .ex or .exs , files ending in .ex are intended to be compiled into
bytecodes and then run, whereas those ending in .exs are more like programs
in scripting languages , tests also end in .exs as we dont need to keep compiled versions of tests .

#### First Program

Create a folder called learning_elixir and inside it another function called hello_world .
Inside hello_world , create a file called hello.exs and inside it .

```sh
mkdir learning_elixir
cd learning_elixir
mkdir hello_world
cd hello_world
touch hello.exs
code .
```

```

```
